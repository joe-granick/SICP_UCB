<P>A <EM>database</EM> is a large file with lots of related data in it.
For example, you might have a database of your local Chinese restaurants,
listing their names, their addresses, and how good their potstickers are,
like this:<A NAME="text0" HREF="#ft0">[0]</A>

<P><PRE>Name:           Address:                  City:           Potstickers:

Cal's           1866 Euclid               Berkeley        nondescript
Hunan           924 Sansome               San Francisco   none
Mary Chung's    464 Massachusetts Avenue  Cambridge       great
Shin Shin       1715 Solano Avenue        Berkeley        awesome
TC Garden       2507 Hearst Avenue        Berkeley        doughy
Yet Wah         2140 Clement              San Francisco   fantastic
</PRE>

<P>There are six <EM>records</EM> in this database, one for each restaurant.
Each record contains four pieces of information; we say that the
database has four <EM>fields.</EM>

<P>A <EM>database program</EM> is a program that can create, store, modify, and
examine databases.  At the very least, a database program must let you
create new databases, enter records, and save the database to a file.  More
sophisticated operations involve sorting the records in a database by a
particular field, printing out the contents of the database, counting the
number of records that satisfy a certain condition, taking statistics such as
averages, and so on.

<P>There are many commercial database programs available; our version will have
some of the flavor of more sophisticated programs while leaving out a lot of
the details.

<P><H2>A Sample Session with Our Database</H2>

<P>Most database programs come with their own programming language built in.
Our database program will use Scheme itself as the language; you will be able
to perform database commands by invoking Scheme procedures at the Scheme
prompt.  Here is a sample session with our program:

<P><PRE>&gt; (load &quot;database.scm&quot;)
#F
&gt; (new-db &quot;albums&quot; '(artist title year brian-likes?))
CREATED
</PRE>

<P>First we loaded the database program, then we created a new
database called <CODE>&quot;albums&quot;</CODE><A NAME="text1" HREF="#ft1">[1]</A> with four fields.<A NAME="text2" HREF="#ft2">[2]</A>
Let's enter some data:

<P><PRE>&gt; (insert)
Value for ARTIST--&gt; (the beatles)
Value for TITLE--&gt; &quot;A Hard Day's Night"
Value for YEAR--&gt; 1964
Value for BRIAN-LIKES?--&gt; #t
Insert another? yes
Value for ARTIST--&gt; (the zombies)
Value for TITLE--&gt; &quot;Odessey and Oracle"
Value for YEAR--&gt; 1967
Value for BRIAN-LIKES?--&gt; #t
Insert another? y
Value for ARTIST--&gt; (frank zappa)
Value for TITLE--&gt; &quot;Hot Rats"
Value for YEAR--&gt; 1970
Value for BRIAN-LIKES?--&gt; #f
Insert another? y
Value for ARTIST--&gt; (the beatles)
Value for TITLE--&gt; &quot;Rubber Soul"
Value for YEAR--&gt; 1965
Value for BRIAN-LIKES?--&gt; #t
Insert another? no
INSERTED
</PRE>

<P>(We used strings for the album titles but sentences for the
artists, partly because one of the titles has an apostrophe in it, but
mainly just to demonstrate that fields can contain any data type.)

<P>At this point we start demonstrating features that aren't actually in the
version of the program that we've provided.  You will implement these
features in this project.  We're showing them now as if the project were
finished to convey the overall flavor of how the program should work.

<P>We can print out the information in a database, and count the number of
records:<A NAME="text3" HREF="#ft3">[3]</A>

<P><PRE>&gt; (list-db)
RECORD 1
ARTIST: (THE BEATLES)
TITLE: Rubber Soul
YEAR: 1965
BRIAN-LIKES?: #T

RECORD 2
ARTIST: (FRANK ZAPPA)
TITLE: Hot Rats
YEAR: 1970
BRIAN-LIKES?: #F

RECORD 3
ARTIST: (THE ZOMBIES)
TITLE: Odessey and Oracle
YEAR: 1967
BRIAN-LIKES?: #T

RECORD 4
ARTIST: (THE BEATLES)
TITLE: A Hard Day's Night
YEAR: 1964
BRIAN-LIKES?: #T

LISTED
&gt; (count-db)
4
</PRE>

<P>We can insert new records into the database later on:

<P><PRE>&gt; (insert)
Value for ARTIST--&gt; (the bill frisell band)
Value for TITLE--&gt; &quot;Where in the World?"
Value for YEAR--&gt; 1991
Value for BRIAN-LIKES?--&gt; #f
Insert another? no
INSERTED
</PRE>

<P>We can sort the records of the database, basing the sorting order on a
particular field:

<P><PRE>&gt; (sort-on 'year)
YEAR

&gt; (list-db)
RECORD 1
ARTIST: (THE BEATLES)
TITLE: A Hard Day's Night
YEAR: 1964
BRIAN-LIKES?: #T

RECORD 2
ARTIST: (THE BEATLES)
TITLE: Rubber Soul
YEAR: 1965
BRIAN-LIKES?: #T

RECORD 3
ARTIST: (THE ZOMBIES)
TITLE: Odessey and Oracle
YEAR: 1967
BRIAN-LIKES?: #T

RECORD 4
ARTIST: (FRANK ZAPPA)
TITLE: Hot Rats
YEAR: 1970
BRIAN-LIKES?: #F

RECORD 5
ARTIST: (THE BILL FRISELL BAND)
TITLE: Where in the World?
YEAR: 1991
BRIAN-LIKES?: #F

LISTED
</PRE>

<P>We can change the information in a record:

<P><PRE>&gt; (edit-record 1)
ARTIST: (THE BEATLES)
TITLE: A Hard Day's Night
YEAR: 1964
BRIAN-LIKES?: #T

Edit which field?  title
New value for TITLE--&gt; &quot;A Hard Day's Night (original soundtrack)"
ARTIST: (THE BEATLES)
TITLE: A Hard Day's Night (original soundtrack)
YEAR: 1964
BRIAN-LIKES?: #T

Edit which field?  #f
EDITED
</PRE>

<P>(The <CODE>edit-record</CODE> procedure takes a record number as its
argument.  In this case, we wanted the first record.  Also, the way you stop
editing a record is by entering <CODE>#f</CODE> as the field name.)

<P>Finally, we can save a database to a file and retrieve it later:

<P><PRE>&gt; (save-db)
SAVED

&gt; (load-db &quot;albums&quot;)
LOADED
</PRE>

<P><H2>How Databases Are Stored Internally</H2>

<P>Our program will store a database as a vector of three elements: the file
name associated with the database, a list of the names of the fields of the
database, and a list of records in the database.

<P>Each record of the database is itself a vector, containing values for
the various fields.  (So the length of a record vector depends on the number
of fields in the database.)

<P>Why is each record a vector, but the collection of records a
list?  Records have to be vectors because they are mutable; the <CODE>edit</CODE>
command lets you change the value of a field for a record.  But there is no
command to replace an entire record with a new one, so the list of records
doesn't have to be mutable.

<P>An advantage of storing the records in a list instead of a vector is that
it's easy to insert new records.  If you've got a new record and a list of
the old records, you simply <CODE>cons</CODE> the new record onto the old ones, and
that's the new list.  You need to mutate the vector that represents the
entire database to contain this new list instead of the old one, but you
don't need to mutate the list itself.

<P>Here's the <CODE>albums</CODE> database we created, as it looks to Scheme:

<P><PRE>#(&quot;albums"
  (ARTIST TITLE YEAR BRIAN-LIKES?)
  (#((THE BEATLES) &quot;A Hard Day's Night (original soundtrack)&quot; 1964 #T)
   #((THE BEATLES) &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; 1965 #T)
   #((THE ZOMBIES) &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; 1967 #T)
   #((FRANK ZAPPA) &quot;Hot Rats&quot; 1970 #F)
   #((THE BILL FRISELL BAND) &quot;Where in the World?&quot; 1991 #F)))
</PRE>

<P>We'll treat databases as an abstract data type; here is how we implement it:

<P><PRE>;;; The database ADT: a filename, list of fields and list of records

(define (<A NAME="g1"></A>make-db filename fields records)
  (vector filename fields records))

(define (<A NAME="g2"></A>db-filename db)
  (vector-ref db 0))

(define (<A NAME="g3"></A>db-set-filename! db filename)
  (vector-set! db 0 filename))

(define (<A NAME="g4"></A>db-fields db)
  (vector-ref db 1))

(define (<A NAME="g5"></A>db-set-fields! db fields)
  (vector-set! db 1 fields))

(define (<A NAME="g6"></A>db-records db)
  (vector-ref db 2))

(define (<A NAME="g7"></A>db-set-records! db records)
  (vector-set! db 2 records))
</PRE>

<P><H2>The Current Database</H2>

<P>The database program works on one database at a time.  Every command
implicitly refers to the current database.  Since the program might
switch to a new database, it has to keep the current database in a
vector that it can mutate if necessary.  For now, the current
database is the only state information that the program keeps, so
it's stored in a vector of length one.  If there is no current
database (for example, when you start the database program), the
value <CODE>#f</CODE> is stored in this vector:

<P><PRE>(define current-state (vector #f))

(define (<A NAME="g8"></A>no-db?)
  (not (vector-ref current-state 0)))

(define (<A NAME="g9"></A>current-db)
  (if (no-db?)
      (error &quot;No current database!&quot;)
      (vector-ref current-state 0)))

(define (<A NAME="g10"></A>set-current-db! db)
  (vector-set! current-state 0 db))

(define (<A NAME="g11"></A>current-fields)
  (db-fields (current-db)))
</PRE>

<P><H2>Implementing the Database Program Commands</H2>

<P>Once we have the basic structure of the database program, the work consists
of inventing the various database operations.  Here is the <CODE>new-db</CODE>
procedure:

<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g12"></A>new-db filename fields)
  (set-current-db! (make-db filename fields '()))
  'created)
</PRE>

<P>(Remember that when you first create a database there are no
records in it.)

<P>Here's the <CODE>insert</CODE> procedure:

<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g13"></A>insert)
  (let ((new-record (get-record)))
    (db-insert new-record (current-db)))
  (if (ask &quot;Insert another? &quot;)
      (insert)
      'inserted))

(define (<A NAME="g14"></A>db-insert record db)
  (db-set-records! db (cons record (db-records db))))

(define (<A NAME="g15"></A>get-record)
  (get-record-loop 0
		   (make-vector (length (current-fields)))
		   (current-fields)))

(define (<A NAME="g16"></A>get-record-loop which-field record fields)
  (if (null? fields)
      record
      (begin (display &quot;Value for &quot;)
	     (display (car fields))
	     (display &quot;--&gt; &quot;)
	     (vector-set! record which-field (read))
	     (get-record-loop (+ which-field 1) record (cdr fields)))))

(define (<A NAME="g17"></A>ask question)
  (display question)
  (let ((answer (read)))
    (cond ((equal? (first answer) 'y) #t)
	  ((equal? (first answer) 'n) #f)
	  (else (show &quot;Please type Y or N.&quot;)
		(ask question)))))
</PRE>

<P><H2>Additions to the Program</H2>

<P>The database program we've shown so far has the structure of a more
sophisticated program, but it's missing almost every feature you'd want it
to have.  Some of the following additions are ones that we've demonstrated,
but for which we haven't provided an implementation; others are introduced
here for the first time.

<P>In all of these additions, think about possible error conditions and how to
handle them.  Try to find a balance between failing even on errors that are
very likely to occur and having an entirely safe program that has more error
checking than actual content.

<H3><CODE>Count-db</CODE></H3>

<P>Implement the <CODE><A NAME="g18"></A>count-db</CODE> procedure.  It should take no arguments,
and it should return the number of records in the current database.

<H3><CODE>List-db</CODE></H3>

<P>Implement the <CODE><A NAME="g19"></A>list-db</CODE> procedure.  It should take no arguments,
and it should print the current database in the format shown earlier.

<H3><CODE>Edit-record</CODE></H3>

<P>Implement <CODE><A NAME="g20"></A>edit-record,</CODE> which takes a number between one and the
number of records in the current database as its argument.  It should allow
the user to interactively edit the given record of the current database, as
shown earlier.

<H3><CODE>Save-db</CODE> and </CODE>Load-db</CODE></H3>

<P>Write <CODE><A NAME="g21"></A>save-db</CODE> and <CODE><A NAME="g22"></A>load-db.</CODE> <CODE>Save-db</CODE> should
take no arguments and should save the current database into a file with the
name that was given when the database was created.  Make sure to save the
field names as well as the information in the records.

<P><CODE>Load-db</CODE> should take one argument, the filename of the database you
want to load.  It should replace the current database with the one in the
specified file.  (Needless to say, it should expect files to be in the
format that <CODE>save-db</CODE> creates.)

<P>In order to save information to a file in a form that Scheme will be able to
read back later, you will need to use the <CODE>write</CODE> procedure instead of
<CODE>display</CODE> or <CODE>show</CODE>, as discussed in Chapter 22.

<H3><CODE>Clear-current-db!</CODE></H3>

<P>The <CODE>new-db</CODE> and <CODE>load-db</CODE> procedures change the current database.
<CODE>New-db</CODE> creates a new, blank database, while <CODE>load-db</CODE> reads in an
old database from a file.  In both cases, the program just throws out
the current database.  If you forgot to save it, you could lose a lot of
work.

<P>Write a procedure <CODE><A NAME="g23"></A>clear-current-db!</CODE> that clears the current
database.  If there is no current database, <CODE>clear-current-db!</CODE> should
do nothing.  Otherwise, it should ask the user whether to save the
database, and if so it should call <CODE>save-db</CODE>.

<P>Modify <CODE>new-db</CODE> and <CODE>load-db</CODE> to invoke <CODE>clear-current-db!</CODE>.

<H3><CODE>Get</CODE></H3>

<P>Many of the kinds of things that you would want to do to a database involve
looking up the information in a record by the field name.  For example, the
user might want to list only the artists and titles of the album
database, or sort it by year, or list only the albums that Brian likes.

<P>But this isn't totally straightforward, since a record doesn't contain any
information about names of fields.  It doesn't make sense to ask what value
the <CODE>price</CODE> field has in the record

<P><PRE>#(SPROCKET 15 23 17 2)
</PRE>

<P>without knowing the names of the fields of the current database
and their order.

<P>Write a procedure <CODE><A NAME="g24"></A>get</CODE> that takes two arguments, a field name
and a record, and returns the given field of the given record.  It should
work by looking up the field name in the list of field names of the current
database.

<P><PRE>&gt; (get 'title '#((the zombies) &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; 1967 #t))
&quot;Odessey and Oracle"
</PRE>

<P><CODE>Get</CODE> can be thought of as a selector for the record data type.  To
continue the implementation of a record ADT, write a constructor <CODE>blank-record</CODE> that takes no arguments and returns a record with no values in
its fields.  (Why doesn't <CODE>blank-record</CODE> need any arguments?)  Finally,
write the mutator <CODE>record-set!</CODE> that takes three arguments: a field
name, a record, and a new value for the corresponding field.

<P>Modify the rest of the database program to use this ADT instead of directly
manipulating the records as vectors.

<H3><CODE>Sort</CODE></H3>

<P>Write a <CODE><A NAME="g25"></A>sort</CODE> command that takes a predicate as its argument and
sorts the database according to that predicate.  The predicate should take
two records as arguments and return <CODE>#t</CODE> if the first record belongs
before the second one, or <CODE>#f</CODE> otherwise.  Here's an example:

<P><PRE>&gt; (sort (lambda (r1 r2) (before? (get 'title r1) (get 'title r2))))

</PRE>

<P>Note: Don't invent a sorting algorithm for this problem.  You can
just use one of the sorting procedures from Chapter 15 and modify it
slightly to sort a list of records instead of a sentence of words.

<H3><CODE>Sort-on-by</CODE></H3>

<P>Although <CODE>sort</CODE> is a very general-purpose tool, the way that you have
to specify how to sort the database is cumbersome.  Write a procedure
<CODE>sort-on-by</CODE> that takes two arguments, the name of a field and a
predicate.  It should invoke <CODE>sort</CODE> with an appropriate predicate to
achieve the desired sort.  For example, you could say

<P><PRE>(sort-on-by 'title before?)
</PRE>

<P>and

<P><PRE>(sort-on-by 'year &lt;)
</PRE>

<P>instead of the two <CODE>sort</CODE> examples we showed earlier.

<H3><CODE>Generic-before?</CODE></H3>

<P>The next improvement is to eliminate the need to specify a predicate
explicitly.  Write a procedure <CODE><A NAME="g26"></A>generic-before?</CODE> that takes two
arguments of any types and returns <CODE>#t</CODE> if the first comes before the
second.  The meaning of &quot;before&quot; depends on the types of the arguments:

<P>If the arguments are numbers, <CODE>generic-before?</CODE> should use <CODE>&lt;</CODE>.
If the arguments are words that aren't numbers, then <CODE>generic-before?</CODE> 
should use <CODE>before?</CODE> to make the comparison.

<P>What if the arguments are lists?  For example, suppose you want to sort on
the <CODE>artist</CODE> field in the albums example.  The way to compare two lists
is element by element, just as in the <CODE>sent-before?</CODE> procedure in
Chapter 14.

<P><PRE>&gt; (generic-before? '(magical mystery tour) '(yellow submarine))
#T
&gt; (generic-before? '(is that you?) '(before we were born))
#F
&gt; (generic-before? '(bass desires) '(bass desires second sight))
#T
</PRE>

<P>But <CODE>generic-before?</CODE> should also work for structured lists:

<P><PRE>&gt; (generic-before? '(norwegian wood (this bird has flown))
		   '(norwegian wood (tastes so good)))
#F
</PRE>

<P>What if the two arguments are of different types?  If you're comparing a
number and a non-numeric word, compare them alphabetically.  If you're
comparing a word to a list, treat the word as a one-word list, like
this:

<P><PRE>&gt; (generic-before? '(in line) 'rambler)
#T

&gt; (generic-before? '(news for lulu) 'cobra)
#F
</PRE>

<H3><CODE>Sort-on</CODE></H3>

<P>Now write <CODE><A NAME="g27"></A>sort-on</CODE>, which takes the name of a field as its
argument and sorts the current database on that field, using <CODE>generic-before?</CODE> as the comparison predicate.

<H3><CODE>Add-field</CODE></H3>

<P>Sometimes you discover that you don't have enough fields in your database.
Write a procedure <CODE><A NAME="g28"></A>add-field</CODE> that takes two arguments: the
name of a new field and an initial value for that field.  <CODE>Add-field</CODE> 
should modify the current database to include the new field.  Any existing
records in the database should be given the indicated initial value for the
field.  Here's an example:

<P><PRE>&gt; (add-field 'category 'rock)

</PRE>

<P>If you like, you can write <CODE>add-field</CODE> so that it will accept either
one or two arguments.  If given only one argument, it should use <CODE>#f</CODE>
as the default field value.

<P>Note: We said earlier that each record is a vector but the
collection of records is a list because we generally want to mutate fields
in a record, but not add new ones, whereas we generally want to add new
records, but not replace existing ones completely.  This problem is an
exception; we're asking you to add an element to a vector.  To do this,
you'll have to create a new, longer vector for each record.  Your program
will probably run slowly as a result.  This is okay because adding fields to
an existing database is very unusual.  Commercial database programs are also
slow at this; now you know why.

<P>You can't solve this problem in a way that respects the current version of
the record ADT.  Think about trying to turn the record

<P><PRE>#((THE BEATLES) &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; 1965 #T)
</PRE>

<P>into the record

<P><PRE>#(ROCK (THE BEATLES) &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; 1965 #T)
</PRE>

<P>It seems simple enough: Make a new record of the correct size, and fill in
all the values of the old fields from the old record.  But does this happen
before or after you change the list of current fields in the database?  If
before, you can't call <CODE>blank-record</CODE> to create a new record of the
correct size.  If after, you can't call <CODE>get</CODE> to extract the field values
of the old record, because the field names have changed.

<P>There are (at least) three solutions to this dilemma.  One is to abandon the
record ADT, since it's turning out to be more trouble than it's worth.
Using the underlying vector tools, it would be easy to transform old-field
records into new-field records.

<P>The second solution is to create another constructor for records, <CODE>adjoin-field</CODE>.  <CODE>Adjoin-field</CODE> would take a record and a new
field value, and would be analogous to <CODE>cons</CODE>.

<P>The last solution is the most complicated, but perhaps the most elegant.
The reason our ADT doesn't work is that <CODE>get</CODE>, <CODE>record-set!</CODE>, and
<CODE>blank-record</CODE> don't just get information from their arguments; they
also examine the current fields of the database.  You could write a new ADT
implementation in which each procedure took a list of fields as an extra
argument. Then <CODE>get</CODE>, <CODE>record-set!</CODE>, and <CODE>blank-record</CODE> could be
implemented in this style:

<P><PRE>(define (get fieldname record)
  (get-with-these-fields fieldname record (current-fields)))
</PRE>

<P><CODE>Add-field</CODE> could use the underlying ADT, and the rest of the
program could continue to use the existing version.

<P>We've put a lot of effort into figuring out how to design this small part of
the overall project.  Earlier we showed you examples in which using an ADT
made it <EM>easy</EM> to modify a program; those were realistic, but it's
also realistic that sometimes making an ADT work can add to the effort.

<H3><CODE>Save-selection</CODE></H3>

<P>Write a <CODE>save-selection</CODE> procedure that's similar to <CODE>save-db</CODE> but
saves only the currently selected records.  It should take a file name as
its argument.

<H3><CODE>Merge-db</CODE></H3>

<P>One of the most powerful operations on a database is to merge it with
another database.  Write a procedure <CODE><A NAME="g29"></A>merge-db</CODE> that takes two
arguments: the file name of another database and the name of a field that
the given database has in common with the current database.  Both databases
(the current one and the one specified) must already be sorted by the given
field.

<P>The effect of the <CODE>merge-db</CODE> command is to add fields from the specified 
database to the records of the current database.  For example, suppose you
had a database called <CODE>&quot;bands&quot;</CODE> with the following information:

<P><PRE>Artist:                   Members:
(rush)                    (geddy alex neil)
(the beatles)             (john paul george ringo)
(the bill frisell band)   (bill hank kermit joey)     
(the zombies)             (rod chris colin hugh paul)
</PRE>

<P>You should be able to do the following (assuming <CODE>&quot;albums&quot;</CODE> is
the current database):

<P><PRE>&gt; (sort-on 'artist)
ARTIST

&gt; (merge-db &quot;bands&quot; 'artist)
MERGED

&gt; (list-db)

LISTED
</PRE>

<P>Since there was no entry for Frank Zappa in the <CODE>&quot;bands&quot;</CODE> database, the <CODE>members</CODE> field was given the default value <CODE>#f</CODE>.  If there are two or more records in the specified database with the
same value for the given field, just take the information from the first one.

<P>(By the way, this problem has a lot in common with the <CODE>join</CODE> procedure
from Exercise <A HREF="../ssch22/files.html#join">22.8</A>.)

<P>This is a complicated problem, so we're giving a hint:

<P><PRE>(define (merge-db other-name common-field)
  (let ((other-db (read-db-from-disk other-name))
	(original-fields (current-fields)))
    (set-current-fields! (merge-fields original-fields
 				       (db-fields other-db)))
    (set-current-records! (merge-db-helper original-fields
					   (current-records)
					   (db-fields other-db)
					   (db-records other-db)
					   common-field))))
</PRE>

<P>This procedure shows one possible overall structure
for the program.  You can fill in the structure by writing the
necessary subprocedures.  (If you prefer to start with a different
overall design, that's fine too.)  Our earlier suggestion about
writing a <CODE>get-with-these-fields</CODE> procedure is relevant here also.

<P>
<H2>Extra Work for Hotshots</H2>

<P>Compare your program to a real database program and see if you can add some
of its features.  For example, many database programs have primitive
facilities for averaging the value of a field over certain records.  Another
feature you might want to try to implement is two-dimensional printing,
in which each column is a field and each row is a record.

compact discs may be disturbed by the ambiguity of the word &quot;record,&quot;
which could mean either a database record or a phonograph record.  Luckily,
in our example it doesn't matter, because each database record represents
a phonograph record.  But we intend the word &quot;record&quot; to mean a database
record; we'll say &quot;album&quot; if we mean the musical kind.<P>
